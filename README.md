# gpt2-outputs
Outputs from running and training GPT-2 on a variety of sources

These were generated using Max Woolf's wonderful Colaboratory notebook as a starting point. More details associated with individual outputs/runs. Unfortunately, models themselves are too big to keep in this repo, but please contact me if you want to use them (if I haven't created a generator) as I should have them stored somewhere.
