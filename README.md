# gpt2-outputs
Outputs from running and training GPT-2 on a variety of sources

These were generated using Max Woolf's wonderful [Colaboratory notebook](https://github.com/tgjohnst/gpt2-outputs) as a starting point. More details associated with individual outputs/runs are present within their files. Unfortunately, models themselves are too big to keep in this repo, but please contact me if you want to use them (if I haven't created a generator) as I should have them stored somewhere.
