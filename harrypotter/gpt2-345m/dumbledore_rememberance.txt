I just wish I could have said a few good things," said Hermione quietly as they sat in the common room, "a few things that might have made a difference, if only I'd had the courage to try. It's like looking through a microscope; every little thing looks different, but you can't help inferring that Dumbledore's death would have been felt by someone who had lived a long life. The ghost of his memory lingers, and it's a wonder that nobody can see it. It's a very quiet world."
"I'd have wanted to," said Ron, "because it was horrible, and I felt that way too."
"I'm sure you've decided it's time for you to go," said Hermione quietly. "I think you'll be all right. I can't think of anything else to say."
"I always thought Dumbledore was one of the most interesting people I knew," said Ron.
"I'm sorry, Ron," said Hermione, "I've been thinking."
"He was one of the best at what he did best."
"He was an absolutely joy to be around. I always thought he was a bit weird, though he was always very funny. He'd have been good at a job or two, and I always liked the idea that he might have chased his talent to the extreme."
"Yeah, I do, I always liked the idea that he might have wanted to do some other thing. He was the only one I knew who never quit, though not a bad one. I can't think why he's been dead for so long."
"He was a great wizarding father, though," said Ron. He looked at Hermione. "His death was difficult. He was such an odd man, and it's hard to make sense of his death, especially when we've all been trying to remember it for years."
"Well, it was hard to make sense of it," said Hermione, "when we all know it was him."
"I know, I know, I can't help thinking that he was the one who was trying to get us through that. He was the one who was pushing us forward so that we could do our best. I don't know why we thought he'd be dead, or why he was so keen to give us another chance after all these years. I think I just felt it at the time, and I don't think I ever really changed my mind. But I know that I was wrong, and I made a mistake, and it's very hard to forget."
Harry could remember thinking about Dumbledore ever since he had heard Ron's last words, and the pain of it had been building inside him for weeks. He could feel it in his insides, and he could not get rid of it.
"I know I didn't want to believe it," he said finally. "I didn't want to believe it, I really did. I just thought he might be dead, I mean, I knew I shouldn't have believed it, but I just’d said it, I knew I should have said it, I knew he might be gone, I just wanted him to be here."
"But you don't have to tell anyone," said Hermione.
"No," said Harry.
"I know I didn't have to," said Hermione. "I didn't have to tell anyone, Ron, I just knew I had to, and I said it out loud."
"I’ll never forget that," said Ron. "I'll never forget how much I wanted to believe it, how much I wanted to get out to the camp. But I couldn't. I was too frightened. I was scared I'd fail. I couldn't explain it to anyone. I kept telling myself I couldn't, I was a fool. I was hopeless."
"But what if he was dead?" Harry asked her.
"I'm dead," said Hermione. "I can't believe it, I don't know what I’ve done, I couldn't have done it, I can’t have done it, I didn't know what I was doing, I can’t have done it."
"But it was your fault," said Harry.
"It was my fault," said Hermione. "You’re not the only one who ever thought he was a bit odd, Ron, he was the only one who knew we’d had a chance, he was the only one who believed in us. He died believing that he had a chance, and I think he would have loved it if I had died, I don't know why he died, I can’t explain it honestly, but I never wanted him to be dead. I always wanted him to be here, I just wanted him to be here, he was my hero, he was so important to me."
Harry and Hermione stared at each other for a moment,
