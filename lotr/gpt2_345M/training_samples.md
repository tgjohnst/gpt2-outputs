`A man came up, followed by two or three servants. They went down and stood near to him. "Come in, Master," they said. 'We are Master Frodo's guards.'
        ' 'It is not the guards that bear on us; the visitors bear the weapons,' said the Master.
       Frodo remained silent. 'No,' he answered slowly, 'but only a handful of people can help you. Some of these I have brought from the Shire, but we have been sent by Aragorn to keep watch in your house and keep you safe at heart. Others of my folk I have chosen to bring to see for a day or two at least.'
      'Good.' said Gandalf. 'We will be pleased to welcome them.'
       Frodo left the hall and came outside into the light of evening. 'Look!' it said. 'The hobbits are home. They have come for good.' 'Yes, indeed.' answered Bilbo. 'And they come all to ask me to speak to you. It is strange to me; but we must be going in peace.'
         He went to his room and threw himself down into a dark corner. He lay down on his bed, feeling the chill air on his face. It was now early evening, but the stars had already risen in the sky. He felt that he could hear them clearly; his head was spinning and he could hear the distant voices moving away into the woods. When he woke he saw that the fire was lit: the hobbits had crept into the room and were sleeping still as though it had been a time of day. Sam had been singing along loudly and loudly as he slept. Merry had risen and been sitting on his bed.
          'Well,' said Bilbo, 'here's another part of my song from old Frodo. I have been thinking about it, and it is very queer. I don't like it.'
          'There! Now you can hear me!' said Merry; 'and you can see what Frodo is thinking about, though he is not very clear now.' At the beginning it was rather strong and rough, but gradually it grew softer and clearer.
          'Look!' it said. 'Now it sounds like this: I am not sure if I ever hear this before, and it is not from the forest. Now I hear it:         This is Frodo.'
        'It is, isn't it, Bilbo?' exclaimed Frodo. 'Well, it sounds a lot like the old song, but no – it isn't! What were they saying at the beginning?'
        'That's a good question,' said Bilbo, 'but I don't know. We might have heard something that is like that, but I can't see it clearly now. I think I have heard some whistle.'
        'So does Frodo,' said Merry. 'There is a sound like a whistle that you can't quite make out.'
       'Maybe we have heard the whistle when we were out at night and came down the path.' 'Of course!' said Bilbo. 'I thought we had!'
        'Well, if that is the music, then we are ready to start!'
       'Well, let us start on this night!' he said. 'It is the last night in our business. I have a song to tell you: it is my favourite, it tells of a great battle in the Shire that was fought by Frodo to keep the Ring from being broken. This is the story of it now; it is not too long since the war broke out.'
      He went in and sat for a moment, and then suddenly he sang:`

`'Come with me!' said Pippin. 'To the bed with the covers on and the doors closed!'
     The king went out and opened the door, and they walked in. Frodo was lying on the ground with his legs splayed, and his arms behind his head, and lying on his sides with hands clasped behind his knees. Sam was crouched on the ground near the foot of the rock-wall beside Frodo.
     The king passed his hands on his face. Frodo's eyes were opened only to a shallow dark spot behind: his hand and the side of his head between the eyes. Fond to his heart of heart he looked at the light within and was healed in his doubts, like a small child who looks on the face of an old friend.
     'The moon is full,' said the King, turning from the wall of stone and turning around to pass his weary feet through the snow. 'I have done my best, and must thank you for all your hard labour. Come! Let us sleep! Come! Sleep and wake in the morning!'
     Frodo awoke, breathing deep. It seemed to him that he was frozen solid beneath a great stone. His head was swathed in the cover of fallen snow, his arms were behind his head, and the limbs were laid flat upon his side. He could now hear, far below him in the midst of the sea, the soft voice of his sleeping kinsman and companion.
     Frodo could make no more of it, though he drew himself up, a little trembling, and pressed his lips to his swollen throat. It was not at times he looked back at his friends: they had been merry and merry, and he had not seen a good story in his life; they were laughing now and again, and he felt that he was the victim of their mocking scorn. He groaned and opened his eyes, finding himself on the rock's brink, gazing down into a dark well from which his mind could not see the light of morning. A chill wind was blowing towards him.
     'Morning comes, and night falls,' said Merry.
     'The snow is falling,' said Sam. 'But I can smell it: it's going up!'
     'What do you think is happening in that dark place out there down there?' said Merry.
     'Nothing, if you take me back to the bridge.' answered Frodo, who had fallen into the well. 'Nothing, if you will.'
     Suddenly there was a cry from above the treeline, and Merry ran from the rock with Sam. With him went the King, coming towards them, looking as if he were running from something, but his face was hidden in thoughts. He seemed almost to be asking:
     'What's happening here?'
     They did not answer.
     Merry and Sam came out, and found Frodo lying as if he had been frozen on the ground. The others were strung on poles, and they could not get off. Frodo was still trembling. They did not move him. Then Merry turned to Sam. And soon it was plain that Sam was dying for what was left to him, and that his best friend, Frodo his prisoner, would be saved only by his life, which would indeed in all likelihood be the last hope.

   In the end they sat with Frodo in the cold darkness, silent, with hands on his breast, and gazing at the pale snow. Merry slept on. Frodo lay for a while with Sam beside his bed. He did not speak. As the night deepened, the sound of his breathing rose, became shrill and clear, and in the middle he began to move as if he was speaking. He said words to himself aloud in his heart and mouth:
   'I hope the wind blows fresh. I'll start. I'll start. I'll start up.'

   Then Frodo stirred and said nothing for some time. Then two voices came together in the dark, stillness. One was soft and soft and spoke slowly in his broken Elvish language, the other a higher and more gruff language. The third voice spoke in a harsh and harsh voice. One could hear the sound of some of the words that were being spoken, and could hear them as words spoken by a dwarf of dwarven origin.
     Frodo opened his eyes wide, and looked around. Then suddenly the voice spoke again. 'Look, my friends! Look!`

   `Frodo's hope hope was that we would survive long enough to reach the top and see the end of this great battle, even if we only ended up there.'
     The moon was shining now, and its curving edge lay over the sea in a thin ray of light. The stars and stripes of dawn had faded behind as far as the eyes could reach. The wind was in the West, and all the trees were alive.
     Frodo was watching the wisps of white flecked cloud about the giant with a keen gleam in his eye: the moonlight glimmered in his feet and head, and he smiled as he saw it. The wind seemed to freshen his breathing, and his shoulders as he walked: it seemed to be the freshest he had felt all summer.
     'But the moon isn't full yet,' he muttered. 'I wonder if the moon will rise again before long? We should hope so. Then maybe I can pass into the desert, and look for that moon. Not that I am looking for it now. I am wondering what is going on in the world.'
     'It's like that about the Moon: something that is growing stronger. We never thought we would live to see it rise again!'
     'I never imagined I'd come so far from home,' said Frodo. 'But I guess I'll never see it again: it's getting old.'
     'But it's growing stronger,' said Sam, 'and it's no moonlight: it's the truth. The world isn't as it used to be. If you want to know. I can see a bit of it before you. It's changing all over the place. Things are going mad. I wish I'd never left home at all. I wish we were in Brandybucks instead of Brandybuck.'
     'And that would just be so, you know,' said Frodo, 'if they were all just going off to war to avenge themselves on Minas Morgul. I'd rather go to war myself. I just don't see why we should go to war over nothing.'
     Sam's face was red as he read Frodo's thought out loud like a poet:
     'It is time we took the road in earnest '
     'It has been a long hard road for a good part of my life, in fact, and I wish never to return to it again'
     'Yes, that couldn't be helped,' said Frodo. 'But we must take the road in earnest, without more ado. What were you thinking about, I wondered if you were going to turn up and help me?'
     'There seems to be other things I should like better than wandering in strange lands, Mr. Frodo,' Sam said. 'And I should like to get more news out of you, if you want it. But you're so eager, that you seem to have forgotten your danger.'
     'I do,' said Frodo, 'but I don't see why there should be any harm in helping, Mr. Frodo. Whether I can or not.'
     'I wonder,' said Sam, 'why you should. If you were really going after Mr. Bilbo, after I heard him talking to the Moon, then you'd know all about the ring. And you'd also know all about Gollum. But to be perfectly honest, I've never been a big fan of Gollum.'
     'All right,' said Frodo; 'but I don't understand you at all, Sam. You don't seem to know anything about him. He hasn't been a Baggins.' And the idea of the Ring seemed to be in his mind.
     'Oh you do! ' said Sam in a clear and commanding voice. 'Why don't you come and see for yourself, Mr. Frodo, at once? It's dangerous. He's got a deadly evil eye.' Sam took Frodo's hand and shook it gently. 'The Ring!' He cried. 'I think you would find that it would make you nervous, and very dangerous. You wouldn't want to come near it again, if you weren't sure it'd go away. But it wouldn't, if you knew what you were going to do.'
     'What's wrong with Gollum? ' said Frodo. Sam rubbed his hands in his ears. 'You can see him, and he can see things: his big eyes on the Moon.'
     'Yes,' cried Sam, 'they are very big. There is a dark secret at work in all the land.`

`'But this is not the way, I fear. This is not a way of escape, I fear. No, I do not think so; and if you think so, you are blind, perhaps: either you see not, or you do not. You would not think of seeking for a ladder up a great ravine with long necks, till you saw some signs that it was you, and that this was the way to go. I did not look, but I know that you mean to go.
     'You see, if Frodo is not found, the Ring will not help us; and you will not learn the way, unless it is set on you.'
     'That hardly seems any good hope,' answered Gandalf. 'You say something like this to yourself and I say: "Hoom, hoom! I am glad that you are alive. Even though you have said that you wished for the Ring. I hope that it will be found in a fight, and for good and for evil in the battle that you wish to fight." I hope that they will find it, and that they will know about it, or it will make their way to them." That seems to me to be a very great wish. And it seems to others that way too loud. The Enemy holds it: to think that you and I, who know so little about such matters, can cast aside our fear and wish for the Ring of Power. I am afraid that it is all going to waste on such foolishness.'
     'You are mistaken,' said Frodo with a clear voice. 'It is not all going to waste.' He spoke with a clear voice, and a doubt, as if all thought of the Ring had vanished into thin air.
     'It will always be the Ring,' said Gandalf, 'and you shall forget it, if you want to forget it or to make it go away. You shall know it in the end of the story, and then I wish to speak with you. You may think I am mad.'
     'I will try to find the Light and save you,' said Frodo with all the reserve of a man trying to explain the end of a great connexion with a series of difficult and ambiguous questions.
     'If you think that you will not get the Ring,' said Gandalf, 'make for the Tower; but that might be worse than wasting my time with you. If the Ring comes, it will be to my rescue, if it comes while your fear is still in force. But I will not ask you for help.' Frodo gave a little cry of disgust, and did not answer.
     'If you will bear me to the Tower, or your doom, I will see to your bed and all the other things that you require. I am sorry, Frodo, that you are afraid of Gandalf, and yet you know too much for your own good, what you will find in the Enemy.'
     'I have never known, nor guessed what sort of Ring you think you have found!' cried Frodo. And suddenly the thought that for once he did not know was reconciled to him: he knew that the Shadow did not hold the fate of the Ring, only the power of the Dark Lord. 'Why, there was one of my best friends in the war, old Pippin!' he said. 'I hope it is him, or maybe it is not; but I do not know the man's name. I have known him for many long, long lives!'
     But for a while there his fears did not seem to be hindering him; and in the end he walked about, as if he had found a little ring among the plunder of the Men of the Mountains; and once he was satisfied, he held Frodo and spoke to him without speaking to the others, speaking in the tongue of the East or the West as they now spoke.
     'If this is how you will escape my protection, Frodo,' he said; 'and I thank you very much indeed!'
     'But this is no good saying ' said the wizard. 'It is answered.' He turned and began to walk towards them.
     At that moment Sam and Frodo turned, wondering whither they were going: it seemed to them that for the moment they were going toward a small house on the far side of the hills. It was an honest-looking house, and on the left hand of the road to it; and behind it the road ran steeply. Down it and beyond a row of green pillars, far away in the midst of the range, stood two tall pillars. One of them was leaning; the other had a raised sword-feather upon`

`they came to that valley, and the trees became little more than tufts of old growth. They rode down the westward slopes of Emyn Muil, and then turned away from the green pastures of Lamedon towards the hills of the Emyn Muil as they marched on towards Dol Amroth. There were no villages here, nor houses, nor houses with houses; only herdsmen with herds. But before the travellers could reach the foot of Amon Hen they were overtaken by a long porter-house and barrow-and-messengery, each with a barrel of wood, and no other furniture or object at any rate of wood, save a few bowls of thick porridge, and an empty beer bottle. All that was needed for the sleep of this weary hobbit was a little water, a snack of fresh fruit, and perhaps a soft bed. At any rate they needed a good night's rest and a sleep for the waking pains.
     Gandalf lifted the barrow. 'Here lies Mablung the Shipwright!' he said. 'We ride to meet him; but we have not yet reached him or spoken to him. We will come and see him in his own time. Rest now, and call upon us when you have eaten!'

   Down from the hill-top they rode, and stood upon the threshold of the Messenger's Quarters, gazing at the stone doors upon the left, and the tall door upon the right; and they did not look more than once at the old building under which they stood. Then each of the four companions slipped from the saddle and got a little closer to the stone doors, and looked back; and they saw all new and strange that they had seen upon the way; and they felt amazed at Gandalf's power of perception, and at the quickness with which he rode back to the walls. There was still a great darkness about them, and the wind was still blowing, but the doors were closed. They were alone on the third day of their journey, and Gandalf was at no times heard singing or singing; his voice was cold and lifeless.
     At the first gate Gandalf came out of the shadows of the house with a welcome and a door open, and he welcomed the travellers. 'Welcome, and may your journeys be many and noble!' he said. 'It is long since we rode from the Misty Mountains, and yet on this last day we ride to the Shire, and perhaps we will find that this same Gandalf will lead you on your way. But welcome also, good Men and Wise, and the Dark Lord will know that you rode from the East.'
     'The Shadows of Mordor?' said Aragorn.
     'I do not know about the Dark Lord,' said Gandalf 'but I fear that he has many servants, and even in the West he may have spies. Be wary! But in the old days he used to travel at pleasure, as you might say. It is an age before he has become dull and patient, as you might say. Still, if we return he will be the greatest wizard the world has ever seen.'
     Merry looked at the door, and sighed. 'We may as well leave it, while we are still here,' he said, 'especially if we are to get to Rivendell.'

   At last the doors closed silently behind them. Aragorn stepped forward to the barrow. 'Come!' he said. 'And may all your journeys be long and happy!'
     Merry bowed his head, and stood there quiet and silent for a while. at length Aragorn spoke again. 'I know it, as soon as I entered the house, and knew it even before you came,' he said. 'My welcome and all thanks to Merry, Warden of the House of Eorl.'
     'Indeed!' said Gandalf 'then you also deserve tributes, lord. More than once I have granted them.'
     'Yes, we do,' said Aragorn. 'That is our custom, when we meet with anyone who will help us, and to whom we will talk. But this I will say in private, whoever he or she be, and whatever he or she be, you will soon learn that I am in need.'
     'I will go and look for the stranger in the house and see if he or she is in need,' said Legolas.
     'Yes, I shall come with you to the Docks as soon as I can,' said Aragorn. 'But I cannot stay long. The young hobbit Frodo must be better. He has not slept since the morning after the dark horse-race.'
     Merry went up to the bed, and laid himself upon it`

`'But in my land it was never in the hands of the English, as you see,' said Frodo. 'If I may venture to say so, it is because the Enemy has crossed over the River and is bound on the Mountains. And why not? It is a dreadful torment for his enemies.'
    'It is his fault, but he does not all his evil deeds,' answered Gandalf. 'He chooses friends, and friends choose friends. It is fortunate for us that we have not had the Enemy as friend, or one chosen for our evil. Yet there are not many friends in the world and there are not many places where those at a loss can turn.'
    'You are fortunate,' said Frodo. 'You may say that I did not deserve the trouble in death. Yet if it had not been for the help of Gandalf, I should have long been forgotten.'
    'You will die in the battle, of course,' said Gandalf. 'Will you not go? I think not. But I do not hope so. I wish you well. Do not run. And see to it that your pledges of faith and courage are kept.'

  He lifted the last phial and held it up and gazed at it thoughtfully. Then he sighed. 'Behold, here indeed is my last wager,' he said. 'It has been well done, I say to my friends.'
    Frodo looked in wonder at Gandalf, and Gandalf looked down at him in amazement, and then with sudden pity he shook his head, saying: 'Never thought a hobbit would see such a thing.'
    'Never!' cried Frodo suddenly, looking up. 'You think I have never used such a wager? Is this the last stroke against me?'
    'Did I not say so?' said Gandalf.
    He sprang to his feet. 'But how I would like to see my friends!' he exclaimed. 'How I would want to kiss your hands!'
    'You have not been idle this day,' said Gandalf. 'Are you in a hurry?'
    'Yes,' answered Frodo. 'I have been slow, but not wholly without my friend's help. My own swift resolution, and my sharp wit has won me many a fair fight; and in the end I have won. I do not feel altogether well.'
    'Do not!' said Gandalf sternly. 'I do not mean to bore you with my talk. Nor do I mean to tell you how I have been helping you to choose your companions, or bringing you up, or even choosing our captains. Nor do I mean to send you to Rivendell or to visit old Tom Bombadil. But I must return to my own business. The Riders are coming. The doom has gone. Will you go away?'
    'No!' said Frodo. 'I must go. I must leave the Shire first, and I must go to Hobbiton and to the Grey Havens. But I beg your pardon. I am in haste.'
    'Very well,' said Gandalf. 'Hobbits go through all the lands that are behind, and they come home. But there are many things to consider, and a journey of many long and distant rides may prove long and unpleasant. I shall leave you until nightfall, as you deserve. It will have to be very dark.'

  The next day Frodo was lighter, but his spirits dropped a notch. He said nothing and watched little. The night passed without his seeing or hearing anything strange. In that way the next day seemed to pass almost without event. But in the days that followed the dark hours passed with greater frequency, and Frodo's sleep became harder and less easy. His limbs grew light and weary. He could not climb stairs or go on roads without the help of a few good hearty hobbits. His appetite grew almost sombre. It was not easy to find or keep track of the Ragged Men that were always with him, and never quite as happy as it would have been without him.
    By the end of the ninth day he was really tired of walking, and he did not go further, until the eleventh. That was the night of Daybreak. The Shire was in mourning. The Riders had vanished. Few people remained in Mordor. There were whispers, and good grins on the faces of the hills; but the moon was now full, and her light fell as she passed northward, and far ahead southward the black shadow of the mountains loomed a little to the north. Suddenly as Frodo got down and began to crawl away once more he felt the hand of Gandalf on his shoulder, and he lifted his head`

`As before Aragorn drove them a long way east, along with the Company of the Ring. Soon after their victory at Ford the enemy came under Orcs, and so lost most of their leading men, who fled when the Orcs advanced; for they were now all set upon them. So the Company now marched slowly and unthinkingly along the east-bank of the Ferry, until it ended in the grasslands about Bree; and it came to an island in the River Celephais, on the north-side of the Ferry itself. There lay many fair hills, among which stood a strong hill-top. It was, as all such places must be, palest among the hills of the Shire, and very many merrily pass about it, though they seldom came nearer than a mile away. It was not a rough hill; its own fortunes, as seemed to have been borne out of the great barren lands that lie round about, had left it little more than an ensign. But there were some caves there that had been made during the evil years, when Boromir imprisoned Gollum; and there were also some places where the dark shadows lay down in deep gullies behind many hills, where no man could possibly tread. They had come to the very heart of the Great River, on the eastern side of the hill, that Boromir had named Sméagol.
     There lived a certain Wise Old Took, who was rather tall and lanky, and like a great oak he sat upon a small mound; but at their feet now upon the banks of the Ferry he had gathered his people and built a house of hallows. For his they called it Took Hill, after his good grey mist-bellow. For the Took had borne the house of Beregond from its making in the days of the Great King, which were now many centuries old. And he was the older of the two; his father was the last Elder that ever lived upon the Hill.
     There were, moreover, some trees growing on the banks of the Ferry, chiefly bay-trees, but there were also eglantine-trees, and there were other trees of diverse kinds, many of which were weeping or gnawing at the stones on the banks to bring them to a greater height. These were of a kind strange to hobbits: they did not grow in trees themselves, but they sucked the fluids out of the ground beneath their feet, raising the height of hill upwards, until it was nearly round. For in places, the ground was covered with pools and fountains like livid swamps, where the foul air passed through to a silver water dripping darkly down: a gully to the dark banks of the Ferry-way.
     At the far end of the hill there was a steep black slope, some fifty feet or less, and here the water flowed up to a sheer drop. It was dark when Gollum had swam down and had bathed his knees, legs, and ankles in it. At the bottom the dark slope turned, for a steep dark slope went sliding down. Even as Aragorn and the others approached the green skirts of the hill, it disappeared before them, and a mist came over the hills like a curtain.
     'It is very black,' said Aragorn. 'It is quite dark for this region, and we are going a good way too fast. I do not like this water, and I wonder what kind of a place it is inside, if we are ever going to find any light. But we shall have to go on paddling, I think: we cannot find the path in the clear wind here, though I do not know what kind of water we are looking for; and we cannot find the shore unless we are flying. There is a steep slope on the eastward side of the hill that we must cross, and then find to climb up, for even the shallowest of us. We must find a path.'
     'Yes, I think we must find a path, ' said Pippin. 'And find a way, if we are going to Mordor. Look at the East, look at it! It is strange to hear a river whispering in the shadows, but it is better than being stared at: water is life, and water is light, and light is life. We need it now – in spite of the darkness.'
     Gimli was silent for a while, his glance straining to remember the long speech that Frodo had heard in the Citadel. Then he burst out: 'I am getting so heavy now that the little boat I was carrying looks like a small island in the water!' He tossed the old bundle in the water.
     'It is a curious tale, but it is no cause for alarm,' said Aragorn.`

`A little while later Gandalf came and examined the chest. There were no other wounds or bruises that Frodo could see. 'I suppose that you have been on the road?' he asked.
     'Yes, I have been on the road,' answered Frodo. 'But I did not see the riders. I thought only of my master and of Sam.'
     'They were far away,' said Gandalf. 'I hoped that they were still in your company; for you are a most careful worker and tracker, I guess. I hope that you have not been in your chambers too long. Seldom does a hobbit roam free in the Wild today, as you have been. And to think that you were ever afraid to open them in your sleep!'
     'Well no, I am content,' said Frodo. 'It is a bitter thing to think that you were ever afraid to open them, as is the custom in the Shire. But as long as I live, I shall not be able to bear to look on the houses of the dead; nor would that comfort me, now that memory has been strained in my mind. There, my mind will be drawn out of memory, and I will be unable to think of anything else. I felt that the White Rider was after me, and I could not find help in battle but his lure. I drew out My sword and set my staff to work; but the lure was broken, and I could not use my staff in anger.
     'I drew my sword and my staff together, but my staff was broken. Sauron sent out his full strength to his enemies, and I was caught between the lust of my master and the compulsion of my sword. I fell, and my magic was broken, and I fled blindly into the shadows of the hills, leaving my master but a broken sword and a wound that would never heal, and my life but a shivering memory of lost love.
     'At that moment I heard the sound of hoofs; and it seemed to me that I was in a dream. I knew now that my doom was near, and that I was pursued by the White Rider. I had no time to waste. I sprang forward, but before I could find a way back I was pursued by another chase; and then other, and then another. I ran, and I ran, and I ran! I came to the brink of the Fell River, and saw Frodo and Sam falling from the hill, and the wind rolling down the hill. I cried out, and gave way, but it was too late. I was already pursued by the desire to kill, and I knew that I would never, never, escape; and I was filled with deep regret for hurting Sam; and I looked out for a way out of the Shire, and my hatred for Gollum.
     'Then I was blinded, and I knew no more. The White Rider caught me in his arms, and bound my legs with cords, and took me into his house. He would not allow me to go to sleep. I was so cold, and my breath was snarling and stinging, and I could not breathe; and he was so hot, and his tongue was lashing out and his eyes glaring: I was in a rage that had no hold on me. I fought him off, and he threw me into a corner in the dark corner, and there I remained until the morning.
     'I tried to run away, for I was afraid of the Rider, but I could not find any way to go in the dark, and I was alone. Then I crawled out, for I was afraid of the darkness and of the Rider. I was just going to run away when he came out, and I could not see him. So I crawled, vainly and bravely. I was always shy of the dark, even in my sleep, and I had never, never been afraid of the Rider in my life. He was so tall, and he had such a fearsome face.
     'He was wearing a white cloak that shone like silver in the sun; and a shining helm, and gleaming plates under his heavy eyelids. I did not dare to enter his chamber. But I got out a little while later, when it was dark and I could not see any more.
     'He was so proud and magnificent; and I could not have sat by him, and I ran after him as he walked beside me. I think that I shouted and puffed, when I saw that he was crying out: "O yes, yes, yes`

`The storm was over, and the sun was setting, and before them a tall peak was seen rising in the West. They were beginning to feel weary. They turned away: their hearts were too busy with their fears to look back.
     'You have no right to tell me how you would feel in your own land, Gandalf,' said Legolas. 'You are coming with me to take me to see my relatives, and my own king. I am going to Elrond's house to see the count of my people and my own folk.'
     'Yes, yes, we shall all be in the king's house,' said Gandalf. 'But you shall tell me of your ride when you come, and I will do what I can for you. I do not know your master's name.'
     'That is ill to hear at a stranger's hand,' said Legolas. 'I am little better than an orc in aught that is by right my own. But I have a head start. Come now!'
     'Come now!' said Gandalf. 'You may have all the courtesy of your own folk when you come to the king's house, but you will not be welcomed by him. You are known to him, and he will find you useful; and you are no friend of the orcs. An orc might have you still alive in the memory of memory, if he had met you in the woods by the ways of your kinsfolk. But I have not come to taunt you. You are my kinsman, and I owe you more than kinsmanship is due to one who has passed through the woods and is on the way to the mountains. You have taken your own counsels and made your own bed, and the moon will rise on your head from noon till nightfall. Your own friends may think so much of you, and of your food, and of your song, that they will think less of it. You have drunk to heart's content, and taken what you can and can not find.
     'You have ridden far and seen much; and now you return to your food, and your food, and the food of the wild, a food of the green grass of the North, a food fit for the traveller in the seasons of the world. But wild it be, as you know, and hard to come by.
     'But you have been praised for your courage in this matter. Do you wish to come back?'
     'No,' said Gandalf. 'That no longer concerns me. The king is no longer under house arrest. No one is in prison, nor in exile, nor even far from home. He is no longer a prisoner of war, though the light of his sword was all the cloak of his captivity roused him to such a degree that his enemies thought he was one. He is free to go, and to come soon. He will take a seat upon the throne in his own house, as soon as he may, by the Lord's leave.'
     'I will come then,' said Legolas. 'Certainly I will come. One who knows me will understand why I have not already come.'
     'Then I will come too,' said Gandalf. 'For not all who wish to come must go home. Those who wish only to see my country and be free of their oaths may come.'
     'Then come now!' said Legolas. 'For you have no errands beyond your own, and your own do not lie with you outside your own country. You are a friend of the king, and your land belongs to him, whether you choose to believe in him or not. You may go and ask for leave to come, and yet have no right to leave until your oath is fulfilled. I will come by your oath. For I am a kinsman of the king, and I will be at your side when you come.'
     'And you,' said Gandalf, 'will be a friend of the lord of the Mark too, if you come, and you will be a companion of the king when he goes to his court. Come now!'
     'Come then!' said Legolas. 'Alas! for I have too late come to the meeting of our needs. These orcs are quite unlike your countrymen. They are fierce, but they are no longer masters of their own fierce things. They are kin of the beasts, not of Men. They slew many Men, and they slew many Elves, and they were content with their own creatures. They had dealings with other Men, and other Elves, and with beasts, and they learned from their neighbours a little of our ways; and they made alliances with the kings of the West and with the lords of the South`
