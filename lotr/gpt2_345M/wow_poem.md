## The lotr model spit out a poem/song, which is amazing

        a little hill of sand dunes,
       where the waters run down to the earth.

           a wide water,
          a white sea.

          a dark pond,
         a wide deep water,
        a dark shore.

         a dark rock,
        a heavy burden,
        a burden light.

         a loaded sword,
        a hapless man,
       a pungent fire.

         a grey stone,
        a broken sword,
        a broken head.

         a broken axe,
        a hapless man,
       a pungent axe.

         a hapless warrior,
        a pungent sprinter,
        a sprinter slow.

         a wyvern,
        a beast of the clouds
        a beast of the mountains
        a swan in a water-park.

         a mighty ship,
        a shining ship,
        a ship of ice
        a burning sail.

         a fearsome rider,
        a shining ship,
        a horsemen of past years,
        a robed warrior,
        a riding-horse.

        an old man with a beard
        a grey hooded figure
        a bearded warrior
        a figure lifted upon a staff;
        a livery worthy of the Kings of old,
        a helm-bearer that leaps high
        upon the wind,
        in a blaze of glory
        in the midst of a hall of stone.

         a wandering wanderer,
        a wandering wanderer,

    a wandering wanderer.

         a weary hobbit,
        a king of the fields,
        a wind that sighs
        in the lawns of the hills.

         he strides alone,
        in shining mail
        in shining armor
        and his shield is glowing
         in shining glass.

         a weary wanderer,
        a messenger from the Enemy,
        a traveller in shadow
        a wandering wanderer,
        a messenger from the Valley of Shadow,
        a messenger from the Mountain of Shadow,
        a messenger from the Sea of Shadow,
        a dark shape under moon and star,
        his shining brows, and his shining eyes
        his shining hair.

        a weary wanderer,
        a messenger from the Enemy,
        a traveller in shadow
        his long limbs, his long hair,
        his bright eyes
        his many garments.

        a weary wanderer,
        a messenger from the Enemy,
        a traveller in darkness
